the transition between the backfill and the streaming writes.

    /* Here's how the backfill works:

    1. We sign up for a stream of writes from the `remote_replicator_server_t`. Initially
        we store the writes in `write_queue_`.
    2. We start backfilling from the `replica_t`. We ensure that the `replica_t` is on
        the same branch as the `remote_replicator_server_t`, and that the backfill's end
        timestamp is greater than or equal to the stream's begin timestamp.
    3. When `write_queue_` reaches a certain size, we stop the backfill. We perform all
        the queued writes that affect the region that we backfilled, and discard all
        others.
    4. Go back to step 1, except that incoming writes that apply to the region that was
        backfilled are performed immediately instead of being queued.
    5. Repeat steps 1-4 until the whole region has been backfilled.

    The `remote_replicator_client_t` constructor blocks until this entire process is
    complete. The backfilled data will be safely flushed to disk by the time it returns.
