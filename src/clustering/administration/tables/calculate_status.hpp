/* Sometimes different parts of a shard can be in different states. To avoid confusing
   the user, we only ever present one state. The ordering of the states in this enum are
   used to decide which state to present; we'll always present the state that's furthest
   down the list.

   `backfilling` has a performance impact so we should display it whenever it's
   happening. `waiting_for_quorum` can cause another machine to be `waiting_for_primary`,
   so we should prioritize displaying `waiting_for_quorum` to make it clear why the
   primary is stuck. `transitioning` is the least informative error condition, so we
   shouldn't display it at all unless it's the only thing keeping us from being ready.
   The `disconnected` state can never occur in conjunction with any other state, so it
   doesn't have a meaningful position in the list. */
